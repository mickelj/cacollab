# CACollab
**Simple, collaborative content analysis and collective commenting**

***Languages***: JavaScript, HTML (Pug templates), CSS  
***Requires***: node.js, PostgreSQL

CACollab is a node.js web application that allows groups to perform content analysis coding simultaneously on a given text.  The interface allows a primary research to upload a document, which is then tokenized into individual words.  A user can then highlight words, phrases, sentences, or more to apply a code or comment to that selection.

Coding and commenting are performed in real-time so the system can function as a teaching tool for content analysis or could be used within the classroom for collaborative commenting exercises.
